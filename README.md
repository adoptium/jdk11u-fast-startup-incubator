## Goal
This is a repository for collaboratively exploring Java startup time optimization ideas. 
The intent is to contribute the resulting work into OpenJDK projects by their original 
authors. Alternatively, resulting work may be moved into a new Eclipse Adoptium project. Please
see [Eclipse Adoptium Incubator](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.incubator)
for additional information.

Areas of current interest include (but not limited to):
 * Class pre-initialization support framework in JVM
 * Static analyzer to identify classes that are safe to pre-initialization
 * AOT
