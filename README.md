This is a repository for collaboratively exploring Java startup time optimization ideas. 
The intent is to contribute the resulting work into OpenJDK projects by their original 
authors. Alternatively, the work may be moved into a new Eclipse Adoptium project. Please
see [Eclipse Adoptium Incubator](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.incubator)
for additional information.

Areas of common interest include (but not limited to):
 * General class pre-initialization
 * Static analyzer for identifying unsafe pre-initialization
